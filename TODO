1. implement Redis or similar IPC, instead of reading full db with each cmd (search, analyze, etc.) it should keep it in memory for 20-30 minutes

2. supplementary field pairing.  export to my ubuntu server via node.js and socket.py: either implement username-password pairs, or just mandate unique IP submissions (allow edits)

3. support for BFDB and CNF

4. implement ServingConversionField so people can use units other than grams

5. optimize and generalize the database class/metaclass schemes

6. parse amino acid db: http://www.fao.org/docrep/005/AC854T/AC854T00.htm

7. convert usda stock flat file to relative, they offer better data anyways

8. preserve support for import flat file db??  big questions..
