Hi,
 
Is it possible to get approximate equations for the RDIs?
 
I am working on free software and need to request it  The food database and extended flavonoid info has been immensely helpful so far.  Any work that you can save my friends and I is appreciated.
 
I am referring to the following page:
 
    https://fnic.nal.usda.gov/fnic/dri-calculator/
​
Australia has a similar service set up, however I am not able to find any credible information on the data or stats behind the scenes of either one.
